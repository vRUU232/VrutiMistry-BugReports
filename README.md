# VrutiMistry-BugReports 
In this repository, I have added 2 bug file and 2 feature request to identify and resolve issues within the software. In this way, users can understand the root cause of the problem and work towards fixing it. Addressing bugs promptly can also enhance the software's reputation and increase user satisfaction. However, feature requests are valuable for driving innovation, meeting user needs, and helping resolve them. By submitting feature requests, users can communicate their ideas to developers, who can then evaluate and prioritize them for implementation. Additionally, incorporating requested features can enhance user engagement and loyalty.
